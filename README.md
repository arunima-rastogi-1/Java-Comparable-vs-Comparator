# Java Comparable vs Comparator  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository explores the differences between `Comparable` and `Comparator` in Java with practical examples using `ArrayList`, `Arrays`, and `HashMap`. It includes implementations for sorting custom objects, handling multiple sorting criteria, and best practices for efficient sorting.  

## 🛠️ Topics Covered  
- **Comparable Interface** – Natural ordering of objects  
- **Comparator Interface** – Custom ordering with multiple criteria  
- **Sorting Collections (`ArrayList`)**  
- **Sorting Arrays (`Arrays.sort()`)**  
- **Sorting HashMap by Keys & Values**
